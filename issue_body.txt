### 📋 Metadata
- **Status**: In Progress

---

Goal: To refine the existing platform into a clear trading decision-support tool that helps users understand direction, timing, risk, and movement without requiring constant chart monitoring.
## 1. Chart / Visualization Layer (Confirmation Only)

- Minimalist candlesticks: Add a basic candlestick chart component per symbol.
- Purpose: Used for visual confirmation of direction and momentum, not deep analysis.
- Features: Include optional session high/low levels and momentum indicators (e.g., RSI).
- Constraint: No advanced drawing tools; this is not meant to replace TradingView.
## 2. Market Activity: Trend, Spread & Volatility

This module provides a technical overview to help users avoid choppy conditions.
## 3. Risk Context: Calendar & Currency Strength

- Economic Calendar: Lightweight display showing Low, Medium, and High impact events contextually per symbol.
- Currency Strength: A per-currency overview (Strong, Weak, Neutral) to explain market drivers.
## 4. App-Like UX & Trust

- Mobile-First Design: UI follows mobile app principles with clean layouts and minimal text.
- Long-Term Goal: Package as a mobile app (iOS/Android) to increase trust and legitimacy.
## 5. Language & Copy

- Trading Terminology: Avoid technical AI-style wording.
- Standard Phrases: Use terms like Bullish/Bearish, Trade allowed/Avoid trade, Late move, and High risk.
- Priority: Clarity is more important than detailed explanations.
## 6. Decision-Support Only

- The platform must remain for support only.
- Output: Provides directional bias, timing quality, and risk warnings.
- Constraint: No order placement or account integration at this stage.
## 7. Pair-Specific Logic Engine

- Unique Behavior: Each instrument has its own logic based on session relevance and volatility.
- Probability States: Uses condition-based states (High, Medium, Low probability) instead of fixed "accuracy percentages".
## 8. Gold (XAUUSD) as a Separate Asset Class

- Custom Logic: Does not reuse standard Forex logic.
- Key Factors: High correlation with DXY, news sensitivity, and New York session focus.
- UI Specifics: Displays Volatility (High/Very High) and strong risk warnings during NY open.
## 9. “Avoid Trade” Conditions (User Protection)

Explicitly flag when users should NOT trade to protect capital:
- Low liquidity (off-session).
- High spread or pre-news windows.
- Overextended moves (high pip exhaustion/late momentum).
## 10. Goal: Reduce Chart Monitoring

The system surfaces critical states so traders don't have to watch charts all day:
- Market bias and Trend strength.
- Pip activity and Timing quality (early, good, late).
- Risk levels (news, volatility, spread).
- Session status with countdowns.
## Summary (Product Intent)

The platform functions as a professional trading assistant summarizing Direction, Momentum, Cost, and Timing. This version includes the most popular pairs for 2026, with the flexibility to add more features as the platform evolves.
