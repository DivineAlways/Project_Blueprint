# 🏗️ Project Blueprint: Standardized Engineering Framework

This repository is a forkable template designed to centralize project management, strategic roadmapping, and architectural decisions within GitHub. It replaces the need for external tools like Notion, creating a "Git-as-Truth" environment for developers and AI agents alike.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `ROADMAP.md`: Strategic vision and high-level milestones.
- `TECH_DEBT.md`: Detailed log of refactors, bugs, and technical compromises.
- `DECISIONS.md`: Architectural Decision Records (ADR).
- `GLOSSARY.md`: Project-specific terminology and constraints.
- `AGENT.md`: Protocols for AI Agent interaction and repo maintenance.
- `.github/`: Standardized Issue and PR templates.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Fork this Repository**: Use this as the base for any new engineering project.
2.  **Initialize `ROADMAP.md`**: Define your "Big Picture" goals.
3.  **Define the Glossary**: Align the team (and agents) on terminology.
4.  **Use Issue Templates**: Start tracking tasks via GitHub Issues to maintain history.
