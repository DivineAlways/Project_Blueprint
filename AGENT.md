# 🤖 Agent Interaction Protocol

This file defines how AI agents (like Antigravity) should interact with and maintain this repository. Strict adherence ensures that the "Git-as-Notion" philosophy is preserved.

## 📝 Maintenance Rules
1.  **Task Summaries**: After every major implementation, update the `walkthrough.md` and link the relevant GitHub Issue.
2.  **Strategic Sync**: Every 5 sub-tasks, check the `ROADMAP.md` to ensure the current work aligns with overall project goals.
3.  **Institutional Memory**: When a significant architectural choice is made, create a new entry in `DECISIONS.md`.
4.  **Debt Management**: If a "Quick Fix" is implemented, it MUST be logged in `TECH_DEBT.md` immediately.

## 🛠 Command Protocols
- **Marketing Awareness**: Before finishing a task, generate a `marketing_walkthrough.md` for GitHub Issue logging (as seen in Issue #13).
- **Notion Replacement**: Do NOT use external Notion trackers. Use `TECH_DEBT.md` and GitHub Issues exclusively.

*Following these protocols ensures a high-fidelity, traceable engineering process.*
